*This project uses backscattered signal from ambient RFID tags to count the number of occupants and their locations in a room using machine learning and inverse problem solutions.*

## Imaging Problem Model

There are two linear problem models developed, using:
- Multipath scattering-based<sup>1</sup> (mainly depending on phase), and 
- Line-of-Sight (LoS) attenuation-based<sup>2</sup> (mainly depends on received signal strength (RSS)).

The problem model from both the approximations look like linear inverse problem of form y=Ax, with x as the reflectivity/ occupancy at each voxel in the imaging domain. There are various methods to solve this problem, depending on the characteristics of A. Our model has highly ill-conditioned and fat A matrix. Size of y is of the order of (#Tags * #Receivers * #Frequencies), and size of x is equal to number of voxels. Thus, it is highly underdetermined problem with size(y) << size(x). Also, in order to solve in real-time, the algorithm should be computationally efficient.

We have used fastest matched-filtering algorithm, and also employed sparsity based solutions, orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and fast iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (FISTA)<sup>3</sup>. Following figure shows we can estimate true object number and accurate location for most cases with one person standing in a 4m x 4m room. The imaging results are calculated using OMP algorithm, and show detected number of clusters using connected component labeling<sup>4</sup>, and their centroid location. For the shown result our algorithm can accuractely detect 1 cluster, with median error of 0.36 m.

## Occupancy Counting
While generated image can provide correct number estimate for upto 2 objects, greater than that, the linear problem model is not valid. So we're using an intelligent neural network based approach, that is able to detect upto 5 object with high accuracy of 93% as shown in the following image. Following figure shows confusion table with true vs predicted number of occupants. Python's Pytorch library is used to achieve the results.
